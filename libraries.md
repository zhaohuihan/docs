List of Libraries for Web Development
=====================================

[angularjs](http://angularjs.org/)
----------------------------------
HTML enhanced for web apps.

[bower](http://bower.io/)
-------------------------
Bower is a package manager for the web. It offers a generic, unopinionated solution to the problem of front-end package management, while exposing the package dependency model via an API that can be consumed by a more opinionated build stack. There are no system wide dependencies, no dependencies are shared between different apps, and the dependency tree is flat.

[grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
----------------------------
The JavaScript task runner.

[highlightjs](http://highlightjs.org/)
--------------------------------------
Syntax highlighting for the Web.

[Jade](http://jade-lang.com/)

Siege supports basic authentication, cookies, HTTP and HTTPS protocols. It lets its user hit a web server with a configurable number of simulated web browsers.
